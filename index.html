    <h2>Album Review by Carey Hodges</h2>
    
    <p><em>Published at 2:05 PM on January 14, 2014</em></p>
    
    <p>James Vincent McMorrow is a true master of texture on his second LP, <em>Post Tropical</em>. Velvety falsetto vocals, plush keys, fuzzy percussion—basically a grab bag of sensual instrumentals—give the Irish singer/songwriter’s work a complexity that is pretty breathtaking.

    <p>A Dublin native, McMorrow first emerged in 2010 with his debut LP, <em>Early in the Morning</em>. The record topped the charts in Ireland, but featured a folk sound that strayed from the singer/songwriter’s passion for soul. <em>Post Tropical</em> is a welcome departure. Packed with stretches of hypnotic R&B, flashes of soul and pockets of folk, the collection has a warm, familiar sound that’s hard to pinpoint…but, damn, it makes for a stunning record.</p>

    <p>McMorrow’s voice boasts the same spine-tingling falsetto qualities as Justin Vernon’s—so much so that <em>Early in the Morning</em> was haunted by comparisons. But McMorrow’s vocals have a velvety R&B appeal that Vernon’s lack. Where Vernon embraces folk, McMorrow gravitates toward a rich, soulful sound—and it’s gorgeous.</p>

    <p>“Cavalier” leads off the collection with a gentle melody, hushed handclaps and some of the highest—almost unbelievable—notes on the record. Later, “Red Dust” recalls James Blake with a seamless blend of electronic percussion and delicate keys.</p>

    <p>True to its name, the title track unfolds like a beachside stroll. Chiming percussion stretches throughout the song, mirroring chatty gulls; cymbals rise and fall like crashing waves; and, eventually, humming background vocals and handclaps blend with McMorrow’s own falsetto, swelling into a powerful crescendo.</p>

    <p>Written, produced and performed entirely by McMorrow, <em>Post Tropical</em> is a breakthrough for the Irish artist. Haunting and heartening, the record is a powerful follow-up, that feels like just the beginning.</p>
